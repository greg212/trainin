Open addressing, or closed hashing, is a method of collision resolution in hash tables. 
With this method a hash collision is resolved by probing, or searching through alternate locations in the array 
(the probe sequence) until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found,
which indicates that there is no such key in the table.[1] Well known probe sequences include:


Linear probing 
    in which the interval between probes is fixed?—?often at 1.
Quadratic probing 
    in which the interval between probes increases linearly (hence, the indices are described by a quadratic function).
Double hashing 
    in which the interval between probes is fixed for each record but is computed by another hash function.
